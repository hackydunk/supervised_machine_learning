# Challenge Overview
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the number of good loans easily outnumber the number of risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Your final task is to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
